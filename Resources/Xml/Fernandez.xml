Hemorrhage from vascular malformations, saccular aneurysms, cocaine intoxication, blood dyscrasias are less common. Early onset CAA is more likely to be hereditary while late-onset CAA is more likely to be sporadic. Hematoma expansion is most common in the first 24 hours of presentation. Seizures, along with high blood pressure, hypoxia, fever, hyperglycemia, and edema are poor prognostic indicators of a bleed.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder with a mutated form of hemoglobin (Hgb S), which under conditions of repeated stress, causes blood cells to take a more permanent sickled shape. After time, this causes endothelial damage and activates an inflammatory response, which leads to vessel stenosis and eventually to thrombosis, increasing the risk of vaso-occlusive crisis. Stressful conditions such as dehydration, infection, and pregnancy may precipitate vaso-occlusive crisis. In addition to strokes, patients may develop hemolytic anemia, autosplenectomy resulting in increased risk of infections, bone marrow infarct (resulting in pain), and renal damage. Heterozygous carriers have added protection from malaria in endemic areas, which is an evolutionary advantage in these areas. In homozygous carriers, the rate of vaso-occlusion can be up to 50%. Treatment with blood transfusions to reduce the Hgb S concentration to less than 30% of the total hemoglobin concentration greatly reduces the risk for recurrent stroke.]]></rationaletext>

Workup may include a transthoracic ultrasound to evaluate for a cardiac thrombus. Carotid ultrasound may also be considered to evaluate for significant carotid stenosis or plaque, since there is an estimated 10–15% prevalence of fetal origin posterior cerebral artery that still arises from the internal carotid artery into adult life. Treatment would be to consider discontinuing the aspirin and starting clopidogrel. From a pure cerebrovascular standpoint, there is no benefit to adding clopidogrel to aspirin in secondary stroke prevention, but the risk of cerebral hemorrhage is increased with the combination (MATCH study, 2003).]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are abnormal collections of arteries and veins, with a higher chance of hemorrhage, while abnormal collections of capillaries are more likely to be seen in cerebral cavernous malformations. In AVM, the abnormal connection of arteries to veins lacks the normal capillary tissue to slow down the blood flow and regulates the pressure transmitted to the veins. As a result, the direct connection of the feeding artery to the vein (also known as the nidus) has poor regulation of pressure on the structurally abnormal walled vessels. The combination of high pressure and structurally weakened vessels leads to the increased risk of hemorrhage. Other symptoms of AVM include headache and seizures, although they may also be asymptomatic. AVMs are often congenital in nature, but may develop later in life.<br>
                    Treatment of AVM includes radiofrequency ablation, endovascular embolism, and microsurgical resection. These treatment techniques may be used in combination.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[Moyamoya is a rare condition associated with stroke. It was first described in Japanese patients and has a higher prevalence in the Asian population, although there are cases in the United States and throughout the world in American and European populations. Patients with sickle cell anemia and Down syndrome may be at higher risk for developing moyamoya. The pathophysiology of development is not entirely understood, but includes stenosis of the internal carotid arteries, leading to revascularization with nearby small vessels. As a result, on angiography, a “puff of smoke” is seen due to these small vessels, which are abnormal and fragile and predisposed to developing ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Patients are at higher risk of developing dementia. Revascularization may be performed directly using the superficial temporal artery (branch of external carotid artery) to the middle cerebral artery, as cases may progress without surgical intervention. However, there may be technical difficulty with this direct approach, and thus an indirect approach may be used, such as encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis or encephalomyoarteriosynangiosis.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[Prosopagnosia is defined as the inability to recognize faces, with preservation of using other cues for recognition. This condition most commonly localizes to bilateral temporo-occipital regions (i.e., the fusiform gyri). Topographagnosia is the inability to navigate familiar places, read a map, or perform similar functions. This condition most commonly localizes to the right posterior parahippocampal region, infracalcarine cortex, or right parietal lobe. Asomatognosia is the inability to recognize one’s own body parts. It localizes to the contralateral superior parietal lobule, the supramarginal gyrus, and/or its connections. Somatophrenia is a form of asomatognosia in which the patient denies ownership of a limb or limbs and may claim it is missing or stolen. Misoplegia is the hatred of a limb. The patient may even attempt to remove the limb by cutting or damaging it another way. It may rarely be observed in a stroke victim.]]></rationaletext>

Alterations to the basal forebrain cholinergic system causes alterations in arousal and difficulties with memory and attention. Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that has side effects of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, vivid dreams, and cardiac conduction disturbances. Memantine is an antagonist of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor. It is commonly used for mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. Reported side effects include headaches, dizziness, and confusion. Propranolol is a beta-receptor antagonist that can cause bradyarrhythmias; however, given the patient’s MMSE, donepezil is the best answer.

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a primary progressive neurodegenerative dementia that has features of visual hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, and parkinsonism. Other features may include REM sleep behavior disorders, delusions, autonomic dysfunction, and sensitivity to neuroleptics. Neuropsychiatric testing will identify deficits in attention/concentration, verbal fluency, psychomotor speed, and visuospatial tasks.<br>
                    Frontotemporal dementia typically presents with frontal dysfunction (i.e., executive function), such as poor judgment, planning, organization, task completion, emotional blunting, mental flexibility, and perseveration. Their memory is relatively preserved until late in the illness. They will usually have psychiatric findings, such as depression, apathy, and/or psychosis.<br>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[Alpha-Synuclein is the protein that accumulates in conditions such as Lewy body dementia and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Lewy bodies are cytoplasmic inclusions typically found in the substantia nigra, limbic regions (e.g., hippocampus, particularly CA2 and CA3), and neocortex. Tau-positive inclusions are commonly found in Alzheimer’s dementia and frontotemporal dementia. They are also found in cortico-basal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy. Amyloid is a protein that is deposited in vessel walls in patients with Alzheimer’s dementia and can result in intracerebral hemorrhage (classically cortically located). These amyloid plaques are composed of A-beta-amyloid and are created by the beta- and gamma-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the N and C terminals, respectively. PrP protein is the normal prior protein found on the cell membrane that can be altered to PrP(sc), which increases the formation of beta-pleated sheets. This can lead to abnormal accumulation of this insoluble protein in lysosomes and cell walls. Ultimately, dendrites swell, causing the typical spongiform appearance of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.]]></rationaletext>

It can mimic motor neuron disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the key findings in MMN is severe progressive weakness, without atrophy and upper motor neuron (UMN) signs. EMG can also distinguish between ALS and MMN by showing findings suggestive of a demyelinating process, such as multifocal conduction block, abnormal temporal dispersion, slowed conduction velocities, prolonged distal latencies, and prolonged F-wave latencies. Pathogenesis is thought to be due to an autoimmune process. MMN has been associated with anti-GM1 antibodies and responds well to cyclophosphamide and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

It is more common in French Canadians and Bukhara Jews living in Israel. OPMD has been associated with short GCG expansions in the polyadenylate-binding protein nuclear gene 1. Malnutrition and aspiration are the most detrimental complications, but most people will have severe ptosis and undergo blepharoplasty. Muscle biopsy will show loss of muscle fibers, with variation in fiber size, increase in the number of nuclei and amount of interstitial connective tissue, as is seen in many myopathies. In addition, rimmed vacuoles and angulated fibers have been described. OPMD is distinguished from other myopathies by the accumulation of intranuclear tubular filaments. Ragged red fibers are seen in mitochondrial diseases.]]></rationaletext>

She initially developed painful cramps in her legs that would last anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. The cramps are worse with excessive stimuli, such as emotion, loud noises, or sudden movement. She complains of having stiffness in her legs, which has led to her falls. On examination, her cranial nerves are intact. There is normal bulk, increased tone with spasticity in her legs, and decreased muscle strength in her lower extremities bilaterally. Reflexes are brisk throughout with bilateral ankle clonus. Sensation and coordination were normal. Examination of the back shows significant lumbar lordosis. She is unable to voluntarily flex her knees, making gait difficult.

It is a rare disorder, characterized by muscular rigidity most prominent in the appendicular and axial structures and episodic muscle spasms, that are precipitated by noise, tactile stimuli, or emotional upset. Stiff-man syndrome has been associated with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) and anti-amphiphysin antibodies. The hallmark features on EMG include spontaneous motor unit activity that cannot be abolished by relaxation (IV or oral diazepam). Medications such as diazepam, baclofen, and tizanidine, anticonvulsants such as valproate, and immunosuppressive agents have been used.

Her examination is notable for sensory loss over the dorsum of her right foot, including the first web space and over the lateral aspect of her right leg. She is unable to dorsiflex or evert her right foot, but has full strength in ankle inversion. There is high steppage gait on the right side. Sensation is normal.

The key finding that distinguishes peroneal neuropathy from an L5 lesion is obtained by testing foot invertors. Peroneal nerve lesions do not involve foot invertors. The following table outlines how to differentiate among types of foot drop. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is due to entrapment of the tibial nerve at the medial malleolus and causes painful paresthesias at the ankle, which can radiate into the first three toes.

In CMT type I, there is a duplication of <i>PMP22</i> gene. This gene codes for proteins that maintain myelin integrity. Histopathology shows prominent onion bulbs, which are the result of repeated episodes of demyelination and remyelination and are composed of concentric rings of Schwann cells. They are prominent in demyelinating neuropathies such as CMT disease. Nerve conduction study (NCS) shows slowed nerve conduction velocities.<br>
                     Elevated phytanic acid levels are seen in Refsum disease, which is neuropathy due to defective alpha oxidation of phytanic acid. It is associated with hypertrophic nerves, retinosa pigmentosa, and onion bulbs on pathology. Deletion of <i>PMP22</i> is seen in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Myokymic discharges are grouped and repetitive discharges from the same motor unit are typical EMG findings in radiation-induced neuropathies.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[Myotonic dystrophy is the most prevalent inherited neuromuscular disease. It is autosomal dominant, with increased CTG repeat in the gene coding myotonin kinase protein. Patients can have difficulty relaxing their grips, hypersomnolence, baldness, testicular atrophy, cataracts, and conduction abnormalities on EKG. Symmetric bilateral ptosis and reduced facial expression is characteristic in these patients. The EMG pattern that is typical in these patients is frequent myotonic discharges with waxing and waning of the amplitude, known as “the dive bomber pattern” because of the sound they produce when the evoked action potential is heard. The disease severity increases with each generation, a phenomenon known as anticipation. Onset of myotonic dystrophy in infancy is associated with decreased life span; however, individuals whose symptoms start in adulthood generally have normal life spans. In congenital myotonic dystrophy, there is a defect in chloride conductance.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[ Paramyotonia congenita is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by cold and exercise-induced muscle stiffness with intermittent flaccid paresis. There is a mutation in gene SCN4A, encoding an alpha-subunit of voltage-gated sodium channel, which is responsible for persistent membrane depolarization. Paradoxically, the myotonia intensifies (instead of remits) with exercise. On EMG, there is a significant decrease in the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential with cooling, despite increased muscle stiffness.<br>
                    Thomsen disease (autosomal-dominant myotonia congenita) and Becker disease (autosomal recessive myotonia congenita) are chloride channelopathies in which repetitive muscle use and exercise restore muscle strength. Andersen disease is an autosomal-dominant potassium channelopathy characterized by periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is due to a calcium channelopathy. Paralysis can be precipitated by a high carbohydrate diet or excessive exercise. There are generally low levels of potassium in the serum during paralysis.]]></rationaletext>

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is the most common periodic paralysis and is characterized by episodic attacks of muscle weakness, in the setting of decreased serum potassium levels. Onset of symptoms is usually within the first two decades and respiratory muscles are usually spared. Unlike in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and paratonia congenita where the weakness is short lived (a few hours), the duration of symptoms in hypokalemic periodic paralysis can last for hours to days. Precipitating factors include physical activity, night rest, a carbohydrate-rich diet, alcohol, or cold. Inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant, and it is associated with a gene mutation involving sodium channels (SCN4A).

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[MuSK-antibody positive myasthenia gravis (MG) involves antibodies that bind to postsynaptic, muscle specific, tyrosine kinase receptors. MuSK-antibody positive MG is more commonly seen in young females and has predominately oculobulbar symptoms. Anticholinergic agents are not very effective in these patients, and they tend to have a poor response to immunosuppressive agents.<br>
                     Antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels are seen in Lambert-Eaton syndrome. Symptoms improve with increased muscle activity and EMG shows incremental response to compound muscle action potential at a frequency of 2 to 3 Hz. It is commonly seen with malignancy, most notably small cell lung cancer.<br>
                     Malignant hyperthermia has been associated with a defect in the ryanodine receptor.<br>
                     Myasthenia gravis is caused by antibodies to postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (nicotinic) in the neuromuscular junction. Muscarinic receptors are present in the CNS, not in the neuromuscular junction. ]]></rationaletext>

JME is an idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome that presents between the ages of 12 and 18. Half of the patients may start with myoclonic jerks and then develop generalized tonic-clonic seizures. EEG usually shows spikes and polyspikes and wave discharges with a frequency between 3 and 5 Hz. Valproic acid often controls the seizures; however, patients need lifelong therapy. If patients are intolerant to valproic acid, other options include lamotrigine, levetiracetam, Topamax, and zonisamide.

He also noticed that his right arm would shake and jerk when placed in certain positions. His arm would twist and pronate when walking. Later on, he noted twisting of his trunk, at first only when walking, but later progressing to even when sitting or standing. This truncal twisting would only be relieved when lying down. Difficulty chewing and talking was noted in the third year. He responded well to trihexyphenidyl for the first 2 years.<br>On examination, his mentation seems intact despite most questions requiring English translation to Tagalog (the predominant dialect in the Philippines), but he is clearly frustrated and he admits to experiencing depressive symptoms. He has difficulty opening his mouth fully and his food has to be pureed. His right elbow is flexed and pronated and his wrists flexed. His right upper extremity jerks and shakes when he tries to elevate his arm. This right upper extremity and truncal distortion worsens when he walks.<br>He has no exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents. His serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper are within normal range, as well as his MRI of the brain. All workup has been unremarkable so far. He has a brother in the Philippines who had a similar condition, but now has more shaking in his extremities and was diagnosed by his local neurologist with Parkinson disease.<br>Which of the following is true about this case?]]></text>

Later on, he noted some stiffness in his arms and decreased dexterity in both hands. He saw his primary care doctor who diagnosed him with Parkinson disease. He was given pramipexole up to 0.5 mg 3 times per day. This caused significant orthostatic hypotension. At one time, he fainted and was brought to the emergency department. He was then referred to a neurologist.<br>
                    On examination, he has a masked facies. His blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg sitting and 90/50 mmHg when standing. His voice is hypophonic. He has full extraocular vertical and horizontal movements. A very mild resting tremor of the right hand is noted only when stressed, such as when asked to recite the months of the year backward. Moderate bradykinesia is noted on bilateral finger taps and hand and arm movements. He has moderate rigidity on both arms but more severe rigidity in the neck. His reflexes are slightly brisk and his toes are equivocal. On gait examination, he is slow, with a normal base, and he walks with small strides. He is flexed at trunk at about 30 degrees, with no arm swing, and he turns en bloc. On pull test, he would have fallen if not caught by the examiner.<br>

Initially, she had trouble using the right hand to perform daily activities, such as brushing her teeth and fixing her hair. She thought that her hand was slow and stiff and she had painful cramping in the muscles. She then started falling and her husband noted her right foot would turn in as she walked. No symptoms were noted on the left side. She saw a neurologist who told her that she had “parkinsonism” and started her on levodopa. She is now on 1000 mg per day of levodopa without much improvement.<br>
                    On examination, she is slow to respond, and she has difficulty following complex commands. She has significant ideomotor ataxia, especially on the right side. She has slightly diminished upward gaze but exhibited a full downward gaze. She is very bradykinetic and rigid on the right upper extremity, lesser on the right lower extremity. Her right wrist is flexed, along with her fingers and thumb at the metacarpophalangeal junction. There is superimposed intermittent myoclonus in the right arm, especially when her hands are tapped.

She then noted some feeding difficulties. She felt awkward handling the utensils. Shortly thereafter, she noticed swallowing and chewing problems, such that sometimes the food would fall out of her mouth. Her gait eventually became unsteady and involuntary movements of her trunk and four extremities progressed over the next few years. She had one episode of seizure. She denied any family history of a similar disorder.<br>

Her speech is slurred and somewhat erratic in volume; sometimes loud, sometimes soft. She exhibits moderate choreic movements in the orobuccal-lingual area, trunk, and all four extremities. She has decreased sensation to primary modalities in the stocking distribution and mild weakness on the distal upper and lower extremity muscles. She is moderately bradykinetic on finger tapping and hand movements, but only mildly rigid. On gait examination, she is very unsteady, wide based, but occasionally crisscrossing her legs, with varying speed and amplitude in her stride.

Optic neuritis is an inflammatory or autoimmune disease process affecting the optic nerve, causing relatively acute impaired vision, progressing over hours to days. It is more common in women and affects patients who are 20 to 50 years of age. The optic disc is normal in approximately two-thirds of patients and swollen in one-third. Pain in the eye is often exacerbated by movement and occurs in more than 90% of patients.<br>
                     Based on the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), a short course of intravenous steroids followed by an oral steroid taper is appropriate to hasten clinical recovery. Oral prednisone increases the risk of developing optic neuritis in the opposite eye.<br>
                     Patients with a clinically isolated syndrome and normal brain MRI are at relatively low risk for clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) and generally should not be offered MS disease-modifying therapy initially.<br>
                     A 1993 randomized therapeutic trial in optic neuritis demonstrated that patients treated with oral prednisone alone were more likely to suffer recurrent episodes of optic neuritis as compared with those treated with intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone. According to the ONTT, 10-year follow-up would predict a 56% chance of being diagnosed with clinically definite MS.]]></rationaletext>

All formulations of  beta-interferon and natalizumab can result in the formation of neutralizing antibodies, which abrogate their clinical and MRI efficacy against disease activity. Patients with neutralizing antibodies are found to have increased relapse rates, increased MRI lesions, and increased flu-like symptoms. There is evidence that neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) affect interferon efficacy and have an effect on disease progression.<br>
                     Changing interferon preparations or route of administration would have no effect, as there is cross-reactivity of the antibodies. Moreover, subcutaneous administration is more likely to be associated with Nab production.

Adverse reactions include injection site reactions, headaches, flu-like symptoms, rhinitis, and fatigue.

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[This patient has had four relapses in the past year and is now presenting with flu-like symptoms. She has likely developed neutralizing antibodies from interferon therapy. Glatiramer acetate therapy is not associated with the development of clinically significant neutralizing antibodies. All formulations of beta-interferon and natalizumab can result in the formation of neutralizing antibodies, which abrogate their clinical and MRI efficacy against disease activity. Patients with neutralizing antibodies are found to have increased relapse rates, increased MRI lesions, and increased flu-like symptoms. There is evidence that neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) affect interferon efficacy and have an effect on disease progression.<br>
                     			Changing interferon preparations or route of administration would have no effect as there is cross-reactivity of the antibodies. Moreover, subcutaneous administration is more likely to be associated with Nab production. Natalizumab carries the risk of opportunistic infection with John Cunningham (JC) virus and is usually reserved for patients who have failed other, safer disease-modifying agents. Mitoxantrone is approved for secondary progressive MS.]]></rationaletext>

Infections with the virus have been documented throughout the United States. 80% of the patients infected are asymptomatic. The symptomatic patients can develop encephalitis (60%) or meningitis (40%) with a subset having an additional acute flaccid paralysis/poliomyelitis. Encephalitis seems to be more common in the elderly.<br>
                    Brain imaging is unrevealing in up to 50% or can reveal T2 hyperintensities in the basal ganglia. Temporal lobe involvement is more common with HSV than WNV.

                     When the calcified lesions are asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. Seizures can be controlled with antiepileptic drugs. In some situations, a surgical excision is necessary as there is obstruction of the ventricular outflow tract. The treatment of active infection is with praziquantel and albendazole.

Clinically, it presents as a slowly progressive myelopathy with leg weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and urinary/fecal incontinence. Features that should make you question the diagnosis include involvement of the arms, a sensory level, and back pain. The MRI is usually normal in most cases, and extensive serologic and CSF testing needs to be performed to rule out other causes of myelopathy.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[Cerebral toxoplasmosis is one of the most frequent opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS, especially with a CD4 count less than  100. HAART therapy and prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole have successfully lowered the incidence of this illness.<br>
                    CNS toxoplasmosis presents with multiple ring-enhancing lesions on MRI, usually with surrounding edema. Neurologically, patients may exhibit seizures, focal neurological deficits, confusion, and even progress to coma. In any HIV patient with multiple ring-enhancing lesions and positive toxoplasma serology, a trial of sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine, and folinic acid for 2 to 4 weeks is warranted. Treatment response is quick and should be evident when the patient is re-imaged in 2 to 4 weeks. If there is no improvement, then a stereotactic biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other infections, such as CNS lymphoma, TB, or fungal infections.<br>
                    Antitubercular agents (rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol) would not affect toxoplasma, and HAART therapy alone would not be sufficient to treat the current infection.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[ The patient in the vignette has a diagnosis of syphilitic meningitis. The history of a painless penile ulceration that resolved on its own likely represents the chancre that characterizes the first stage of syphilis. The diagnosis is also supported by a positive serum RPR. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted spirochete that affects both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Meningitis is most common during the second phase of the disease and can be associated with cranial nerve findings, especially CN VII and CN VIII palsies. The CSF is inflammatory, with predominantly polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), whereas the glucose is normal or slightly high. Confirmation is with serological testing in the CSF, such as a positive VDRL. The organism is very difficult to culture, and as a result diagnosis is predominantly serological. The treatment of choice is IV penicillin.

The condition is rapidly fatal if untreated, and the treatment of choice is with ganciclovir. Diagnosis is confirmed with CMV PCR from the CSF. Cryptococcus is not a common cause of polyradiculoneuritis in the HIV population, and HAART therapy alone will not suffice for treatment.

                <text><![CDATA[A 51-year-old diabetic leatherworker and craftsman presents to your clinic with progressive muscular weakness and abnormal sensations. He states that about 8 months ago, he noticed numbness and paresthesias in the distal upper and lower extremity. Initially he presented to his PCP’s office, who felt that his symptoms were most likely secondary to his poor sugar control, although his Hb A1c at that time was 6.1. His sugar control with the addition of metformin to his regimen has since been optimized and his Hb A1c improved to 5.5. His sensory symptoms progressed, involving his proximal forearms and waist. About 4 months ago he began developing severe muscular atrophy with coordination difficulty and eventually developed double vision. On review of his occupational exposure, he mentions that about 1 to 2 months prior to his symptom onset he began using a new cleaning solvent on his crafts and on his leatherwork. On examination, vibration and pinprick sensation were diminished and marked hyporeflexia was noted in the biceps, patellar, and Achilles deep tendon reflexes. Heavy metal screen was normal and peripheral nerve workup, including copper, zinc, cryoglobulin, and B12, were essentially negative. Imaging of the CNS was negative. Nerve conduction studies revealed a progressive motor-sensory neuropathy with predominant distal nerve involvement. Which of the following would most likely lead to a diagnosis as to the cause of his peripheral neuropathy?

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[ Narcolepsy. This patient gives a classic history for narcolepsy. She has three of the typical clinical features of narcolepsy: excessive daytime sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and sleep attacks. She should be questioned about the presence of cataplexy, which is also often present in these patients. The onset of narcolepsy in most cases is in adolescents and young adults, between the ages of 15 and 30, and may be associated with cataplexy.<br>
                     Typical clinical characteristics:<br>
                     Sleep attacks are the tempting desire to fall asleep in inappropriate circumstances and at inappropriate places, such as while driving, eating, walking, running, working, sitting, listening to lectures, or watching television or movies. These usually last a few minutes, but may last up to 30 minutes.<br>
                     Cataplexy is a sudden loss of tone in all voluntary muscles, except the respiratory and ocular muscles. These are triggered by emotional factors, such as laughter or anger. Patient may experience head nodding, sagging of the jaw, knee buckling, dropping of objects with their hands, dysarthria, and slumping over or even falling. These usually last a few seconds, but may last up to 1 to 2 minutes, and consciousness is intact during these attacks. Examination during an event reveals flaccidity of the muscles and absence or markedly reduced deep tendon reflexes. An EEG recording shows evidence of wakefulness during spells, but if the attack lasts longer than 1 to 2 minutes, the EEG shows REM sleep.<br>
                     Sleep paralysis is the sudden paralysis of one or both sides of the body or of one limb that occurs either during sleep onset while falling asleep (hypnagogic) or upon awakening (hypnopompic) in the morning. The patient is unable to move or speak and consciousness is still preserved. These attacks last from a few minutes to 15 to 20 minutes.
                     Hypnagogic hallucinations occur either at sleep onset or upon awakening in the morning (hypnopompic) and are most commonly vivid and visual, but may also be auditory or vestibular.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[  Ramelteon is used to treat insomnia. It is the first in a new class of sleep agents that selectively binds to the melatonin receptor MT1 with the highest affinity and to MT2 receptors (to a lesser degree) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, versus binding to GABA-A receptors, such as with drugs like zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon. It is thought to be involved in the maintenance of the circadian rhythm underlying the normal sleep-wake cycle. Ramelteon is approved by the FDA for long-term use and has sleep-promoting effects, such as a decrease in sleep latency, an increase in sleep efficiency, and an increase in total sleep time. Ramelteon does not show any appreciable binding to GABA-A receptors, which are associated with anxiolytic, myorelaxant, and amnesic effects.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[ Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is a sleep condition in which the patient moves limbs involuntarily during sleep and has symptoms or problems related to the movement. Patients with PLMD will complain of excessive daytime sleepiness, trouble falling asleep at night, and difficulty staying asleep throughout the night. Movements are counted if they occur during sleep and have duration of 0.5 to 5 seconds and if they occur in a series of four or more consecutive contractions with intervals between movements of 5 to 90 seconds from the onset of one limb movement to the onset of the next. The amplitude of the EMG is at least 25% greater than that of baseline during biocalibrations. Periodic movements of the legs (more rarely the arms) at intervals of 10 to 90 seconds are one of the causes of disturbed sleep. Periodic leg movements are only scored if at least 4, about equally spaced, occur in sequence. If the movements cause the sleeper to awaken, they can become a major reason for excessive daytime somnolence. A few periodic limb movements that do not lead to evidence of arousal are considered normal. Periodic limb movements are often associated with disordered breathing.]]></rationaletext>

The need to move and unpleasant sensations are exclusively present or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching; and are generally worse or exclusively occur in the evening or night.]]></rationaletext>

These are triggered by emotional factors, such as laughter and anger. Patients may experience head nodding, sagging of the jaw, knee buckling, dropping objects with their hands, dysarthria, slumping over, or even falling. These usually last a few seconds, but may last up to 1 to 2 minutes, and consciousness is intact during these attacks. Examination during an event reveals flaccidity of the muscles and absence or markedly reduced deep tendon reflexes. An EEG recording shows evidence of wakefulness during spells, but if the attack lasts longer than 1 to 2 minutes, the EEG shows REM sleep. The frequency of cataplexy decreases over time.]]></rationaletext>

It is not routinely used to evaluate the daytime somnolence associated with suspected obstructive sleep apnea, other medical or neurological disorders, insomnia, or circadian rhythm sleep disorders. The MSLT is the standard for the objective measurement of sleepiness. It involves a series of 4 or 5 controlled nap sessions using a standardized protocol to optimize interpretability of the results. Persons with narcolepsy tend to fall asleep more quickly and have a propensity for REM sleep during naps. An MSLT result of 5 minutes or less across the 4 or 5 naps and the presence of two REM-onset naps on the MSLT along with the appropriate clinical presentation are highly suggestive of narcolepsy. A polysomnogram (PSG) should be performed the night before the MSLT to assess nighttime sleep quality and quantity.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[This patient has two of the four classic narcolepsy symptoms: excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep paralysis. The other two symptoms, cataplexy and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations are not present. Not all of these symptoms are present in every patient diagnosed with narcolepsy. Moreover, patients without narcolepsy may also experience one or more of these symptoms on occasion. The patient has other key complaints that are more suggestive of a circadian rhythm disorder than of narcolepsy, specifically delayed sleep phase syndrome. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in her evaluation would be for her to maintain daily sleep logs over the next month. Sleep hygiene tips as well as the importance of obtaining a minimum of 7.5 to 8.5 hours of sleep need to be emphasized and should be part of her management once her sleep logs are reviewed. The patient currently has no symptoms consistent with sleep-disordered breathing or any other reason to warrant a polysomnogram (PSG) at this time. An MSLT may be considered in the future as well if she is found not to have a circadian disorder or if other symptoms consistent with narcolepsy are present. Setting up a back-up clock may be helpful while she is in the process of being evaluated, but is by no means adequate in the management of her symptoms.]]></rationaletext>

The type of schizencephaly seen in this image is an “open lip” schizencephaly where there is cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) between the margins of gray matter that extend out to the cortex, whereas a “closed lip” schizencephaly is without a CSF-filled cleft in the gray matter that extends out from the ventricle to the cortex. Lissencephaly refers to “smooth brain” without gyri or sulci. Porencephaly is associated with a focus of encephalomalacia caused by an insult to the brain that merges with the ventricles. Colpocephaly refers to a finding of abnormal dilatation of the posterior horns of the lateral ventricle and is a nonspecific finding. Periventricular encephalomalacia may refer to a prior watershed ischemic damage seen in premature infants, resulting in abnormal configuration of the ventricles with gliosis (in the form of hyperintense lesions) around the periventricular region.]]></rationaletext>

Optic neuritis may be the first manifestation of MS. This image does not show a neoplastic growth of the optic nerve that would be a component of neurofibromatosis, and thus looking for café-au-lait spots would not be indicated. Graves ophthalmopathy leads to inflammation of the extraocular muscles, which is hypertrophy. The optic nerve is not directly affected unless it is compressed by the muscle. Diabetes may result in an oculomotor nerve palsy via ischemic pathology that does not affect the optic nerve directly (vision should be preserved). Optic nerve enhancement gives objective evidence that malingering may be less likely in this case.]]></rationaletext>

Craniopharyngiomas commonly have calcification and cystic components and show significant enhancement after gadolinium. Pituitary microadenomas are by definition less than 1 cm, so they would not be as large as depicted here. Pituitary macroadenomas are greater than 1 cm. These start out in the sella and grow into the suprasellar space with a homogeneous mass. If they outgrow their blood supply, they may infarct and hemorrhage (pituitary apoplexy). Macroadenomas also enlarge the sella turcica since that is their origin, which is not seen in craniopharyngiomas. Metastases to the pituitary gland are primarily sellar but may spread to the suprasellar region. There may be surrounding edema. These lesions enhance brightly after gadolinium administration. Lymphocytic hypophysitis is an inflammatory disease of the pituitary gland, also mainly in the sella turcica, but it may spread to the infundibulum. Intrasellar aneurysm will have a large flow void in the sella, with enhancement after gadolinium.]]></rationaletext>

Multiple sclerosis may be tumefactive and have surrounding edema, but is not usually associated with restricted diffusion on DWI. Although cardiogenic emboli have restricted diffusion, the lesions do not have ring-enhancing lesions.

Arachnoid cysts typically are supratentorial with signal characteristics very similar to epidermoid cysts on T1- and T2-weighted images.

As a result of an abnormal communication of the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus, there is flow from the high pressure arterial system to the lower pressure venous system, which leads to engorgement of the veins. The axial image shows enlarged cavernous sinus and ophthalmic veins, especially on the left side. In the axial and coronal views, the image depicts dilated left superior and inferior ophthalmic veins. Optic neuritis and optic nerve glioma may be associated with enhancement of the optic nerve and is best seen with an MRI after gadolinium (not CT angiography in this case). Thyroid ophthalmopathy shows abnormal enlargement of the periorbital muscles (which may be asymmetrical). Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is an inflammatory process that affects the cavernous sinus that is idiopathic. Instead of engorgement of the ophthalmic veins, Tolosa-Hunt may be associated with thrombosis.]]></rationaletext>

Positive sharp waves are abnormal spontaneous potentials seen at rest with the needle examination in a muscle and are biphasic in morphology with initial positivity followed by a slower negative phase back to the baseline. They may fire regularly with the amplitude reducing at each successive potential until it completely dissipates. Fibrillation potentials have a triphasic pattern of initial positivity (downward deflection), then negativity (upward) across the baseline, then positivity (downward) again back to the baseline. Fasciculation potential is a single, spontaneous discharge of a motor unit, thus having the morphology of a motor unit that fires at 1 to 2 Hz, more slowly than a voluntary motor unit (4–5 Hz at the slowest).

The second phase is positive in polarity (downgoing) and is most prominent. Herpes simplex encephalitis is seen with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs), which are unilateral in the EEG tracing. Pentobarbital coma is either associated with suppression of background activity or suppression with intermittent bursts depending on the degree of suppression. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is associated with periodic sharp wave complexes that are biphasic, not triphasic. Eye-blink artifact occurs over the frontopolar and frontal electrodes but do not typically extend deeply to the central, parietal, or temporal regions.  ]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[   Neonatal seizures are never generalized as tonic-clonic seizures because of the incomplete myelination of the neonatal brain. Many newborns who are suspected of having generalized tonic-clonic seizures are actually jittery. A way to distinguish jitteriness from a seizure is to observe whether or not touch, noise, or motion provokes the behavior (occurs with jitteriness), or whether the movement can be suppressed by gently holding the part of the neonate manifesting the movement.<br>
                     eonates with hydranencephaly or atelencephalia are capable of generating seizures from either hemisphere or the brainstem. Because of the lack of myelination in the neonate, seizures may be confined to the brainstem and likewise are unable to generate secondary bilateral synchrony.
                     n an otherwise normal full-term baby who is alert and responsive, focal clonic seizures indicate a cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. These seizures usually involve one or both limbs on one side of the baby. They do not “march” clinically as the activity cannot spread through the motor cortex with incomplete myelination.<br>
                     Neonates have a wide variety of seizure patterns and most are poorly organized or difficult to distinguish from normal activity. Fifty percent of prolonged epileptiform discharges seen on EEG are not associated with any clinical changes in the neonate.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[   Given the history of an antecedent illness, which may very well be food poisoning from Campylobacter jejuni, followed by the development of external ophthalmoplegia, weakness, ataxia, and areflexia, the most likely diagnosis in this case is the Miller-Fisher variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GQ1B autoantibodies will indeed be positive in this form of GBS, as well as Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, ophthalmoplegia without ataxia, and isolated oculomotor palsies. It is true that GBS is associated with albuminocytological dissociation, though this is only seen in 43–87% of patients with this syndrome. Not only are children less frequently affected by the Miller-Fisher variant of GBS, but their disease is also more benign. Miller-Fisher syndrome does indeed show peripheral and central conduction defects on brainstem auditory evoked potentials.   ]]></rationaletext>

They can also have headaches associated with these recurrent symptoms, but not always. These symptoms are often replaced by more typical migraine headaches by the teenage years. Children between 2 and 6 years of age who present with recurrent episodes of ataxia or unsteady gait that lasts a few minutes each time, sometimes associated with nystagmus and/or pallor, have benign paroxysmal vertigo. There is often a positive family history of migraine in these cases, and these children often later develop migraine headaches as well. Ocular migraine consists of a patient who often has a history of migraine or at least a family history of migraine. Most of these attacks last for only minutes, but can result in permanent ocular changes. Paroxysmal torticollis is a rare benign disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of head tilt associated with headache, nausea, and vomiting. Recurrent episodes of syncope have been linked to psychiatric conditions but not to migraine.   ]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[   This child likely carries the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome because she has both motor and vocal tics that have been present for more than 1 year. She is at the mean age of presentation, which is 6 to 7 years old, and her tics will likely get worse before they get better because the most severe period of tic severity is from 8 to 12 years. Half of children with tics have ADHD and a third have OCD, but this is not required for the diagnosis of Tourette’s. Tics occur more often in times of stress or excitement, though they do not occur during sleep in Tourette. Most of these children’s tics will abate by the age of 18, and most do not need treatment unless their tics are particularly bothersome to their lives.

This is a syndrome that is on the severe spectrum of phenotypes, including Refsum disease and adrenoleukodystrophy. Hypotonia is a prominent feature of this disorder. Affected newborns can also have arthrogryposis, weak sucking/crying, hypoactive or absent tendon reflexes, dysmorphic features, including a high forehead and unusual fullness of the cheeks (pear-shaped head), widened sutures, micrognathia, high-arched palate, flattening of the bridge of the nose, and hypertelorism. Most children will develop seizures that are difficult to control and die before 1 year of age. Diagnosis is made by increased very-long-chain fatty acids in the serum, reduced plasmalogens in RBC membranes, reduced rate of plasmalogen synthesis in skin fibroblasts, and urine showing increased concentrations of pipecolic acid and excessive bile acid intermediates. Organ abnormalities include biliary cirrhosis, polycystic kidneys, retinal degeneration, and cerebral malformations.   ]]></rationaletext>

You note on exam that the child uses the Gower maneuver to rise off the floor after vigorously crying for mom to help him. His strength is also diminished in his proximal muscles. There is no evidence of any bulbar weakness. Mom states that she had an aunt who “needed a wheelchair and died as a child,” but cannot provide further information.

SMA is a disease of the anterior horn cells that can be inherited in an autosomal-recessive, autosomal-dominant, or X-linked fashion. Type I is the most common type and most severe. This type always begins in infancy before 6 months of age. Type II is the intermediate type, which presents from 6 to 18 months of age. The juvenile type (type III) presents after 18 months of age. There is also a type coined spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type I. Tay-Sachs disease presents in similar ways, but children with this disease will not have a defect on chromosome 5. They will, however, show symptoms of cerebral degeneration after motor neuron dysfunction is established and skin biopsy in Tay-Sachs will show a deficiency or absence of hexosaminidase-A activity.   ]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[   DMD and BMD are phenotypic expressions of a gene defect at the Xp21 site. In DMD, dystrophin content is less than 3% and in Becker, dystrophin content is 3–20%. Although there is considerable variability in expression of DMD, onset is always before age 5 and often before age 3. Most children retain their ability to walk and climb stairs until 8 years of age. Motor decline is linear throughout childhood, though it may appear static between the ages of 3 and 6 because of cerebral maturation. It is also true that at diagnosis (if made before the age of 5) CK is 10 times the upper limit of normal, and it will then decline approximately 20% per year. Neither DMD nor BMD are curable, although treatment with steroids can increase the strength and function of these children and possibly delay wheelchair dependence.   ]]></rationaletext>

Onset of this disease is usually between 11 and 18 years of age. Children will present with a tonic-clonic or myoclonic seizure followed by progressive myoclonus, mental retardation, ataxia, spasticity, and voluntary movements. Lafora disease is caused by a gene mutation in the laforin or malin gene, and antemortem evaluation shows periodic acid-Schiff-positive inclusion bodies in liver or sweat glands. These inclusion bodies, however, sometimes do not appear until late in the disease and may be absent in some cases. Unverricht-Lundborg syndrome is a similar progressive myoclonic epilepsy syndrome inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, though inclusion bodies are not present. Onset of this disease is between 6 and 15 years, and the gene defect causes defective functioning of a cysteine protease inhibitor.   ]]></rationaletext>

People with this condition usually have an REM onset of approximately 20 minutes as compared with 90 minutes in the normal population. This condition has four major components: Narcolepsy refers to short sleep attacks that occur during the day, cataplexy is a sudden loss of tone usually induced by strong emotion, hypnagogic hallucinations are vivid visual and auditory perception occurring in transition between sleep and wakefulness, and sleep paralysis is when the patient is mentally awake but unable to move because of generalized hypotonia. Sleep paralysis occurs in 2/3 of patients with narcolepsy. Evidence suggests that this condition is caused by an immunologically mediated destruction of hypocretin-containing cells, and people with this condition usually have an 85–95% reduction in the number of orexin/hypocretin-containing neurons.   ]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[   Kearns-Sayre syndrome is a multisystem disorder involving the neurological, endocrine, cardiac, GI, and rarely, renal systems. The clinical triad is progressive ophthalmoplegia, cardiac conduction defects, and atypical retinitis pigmentosa. The clinical criteria for diagnosis include onset before age 20, pigmentary retinopathy, and at least one of the following: heart block, cerebellar ataxia, or cerebral spinal fluid protein level greater than 100. Kearns-Sayre is a mitochondrial disorder caused by a deletion in mtDNA. Skeletal or ocular muscle biopsy will show ragged red fibers. The prognosis is poor and often requires pacemaker placement. Death usually occurs by the third or fourth decade.   ]]></rationaletext>

If a newborn exhibits abnormalities in tone or reflexes, it may give a false impression of CP as these abnormalities may subside later if they are a result of a transient perinatal insult to the brain. The Apgar score at 5 minutes has not been shown to correlate with the development of CP. Perinatal asphyxia is a known case of CP, though prenatal insults are thought to be the major cause of CP. Approximately 25% of children with CP are retarded or have some behavioral or cognitive disturbance.   ]]></rationaletext>

Dandy-Walker malformation consists of a ballooning of the posterior half of the fourth ventricle, often associated with failure of the foramen of Magendie to open, aplasia of the posterior cerebellar vermis, heterotopia of the inferior olivary nuclei, and pachygyria of the cerebral cortex. This malformation is not associated with polymicrogyria and the size of the lateral ventricles does not correlate with the size of the cyst in the fourth ventricle. Diagnosis at birth only occurs in approximately 25% of affected infants and in approximately 75% by 1 year. Children usually present with macrocephaly as the initial feature. Other clinical findings include apneic spells, nystagmus, truncal ataxia, cranial nerve palsies, and hyperreflexia in the legs. Both macrocephaly and ataxia in a child are indications for an MRI. Decompression of the cyst provides relief of symptoms, though approximately 2/3 of children will require shunting and even after successful shunt placement, children will often have transitory episodes of lethargy, personality change, and vomiting that can falsely suggest shunt failure.]]></rationaletext>

Bladder sensation may be preserved in incomplete spinal cord lesions. In cauda equine lesions, if the motor nerves are preferentially involved, volitional voiding may be severely compromised, although bladder sensation may be largely preserved. In patients with detrusor hyperreflexia without outlet obstruction or urinary retention, anticholinergic drugs are the most appropriate treatment. However, the normal accepted residual volume is only 100 mL.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[   The patient has Horner syndrome. This condition is classically defined as ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. When examined in the dark, the anisocoria is increased and there is a dilation lag of the affected eye. The ciliospinal reflex will not be intact on the affected side. This reflex is tested by applying a noxious stimulus to the neck, which activates sympathetic outflow and normally causing pupillary dilation.
                     Knowing the anatomy of the sympathetic tract will help with localization of lesions in Horner syndrome. The first-order neuron originates in the hypothalamus. It descends to the T1/T2 level, where it then enters the sympathetic chain as a second-order neuron. At the superior cervical ganglion, it then synapses and ascends with the internal carotid artery as a third-order neuron. The fibers supplying sweat glands branch prior to the third-order neuron; thus, lesions of the third-order neuron will have intact sweat glands.    ]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[   The patient likely has multiple sclerosis, but further testing is needed to confirm. She presents with a relative afferent pupillary defect, also known as a Marcus Gunn pupil. This lesion classically will appear as dilation of the affected pupil on swinging pen light test. The lesion is located anterior to the optic chiasm.
                     Constriction of pupils less in light than with accommodation describes light-near dissociation (or Argyll-Robertson pupils). It is seen in diabetes, syphilis, and Parinaud syndrome. The mechanism is largely unknown.

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[   The patient has classic one-and-half syndrome. This syndrome is secondary to a lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) and adjacent abducens nucleus or paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF). The MLF lesion alone would cause decreased adduction of the ipsilateral eye (i.e., complete gaze paretic eye). The abducens nucleus lesion will prevent abduction of the ipsilateral eye but also abduction of the contralateral eye through the opposite MLF.
                     An internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) will have the inability to adduct the ipsilateral eye and nystagmus on abduction of the contralateral eye. Adduction with convergence is preserved.
                     Wall-eyed bilateral INO (WEBINO) is due to a lesion affecting the convergence center (i.e., pretectal region), thus causing bilateral eye divergence.
                     Eight-and-half syndrome is similar to one-and-half syndrome, but the lesion also encompasses the facial nerve nucleus resulting in ipsilateral facial motor palsy.
                     Parinaud syndrome is due to a lesion of the dorsal midbrain, causing impaired upgaze, large, irregular pupils (light-near dissociation), eyelid abnormalities, and impaired convergence. These patients will have a classic “setting sun” appearance.    ]]></rationaletext>

                    Bilateral thalamic infarcts secondary to thromboembolism of the artery of Percheron can cause vertical gaze palsy by affecting the rostral midbrain.    ]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[Charles Bonnet hallucinations are typically seen in elderly patients with decreased vision either from glaucoma, cataracts, or central visual field. It is most common in the evening. The hallucinations are typically well-formed bright objects or can be animated people. The mechanism is thought to originate from the occipito-temporal cortex as a result of visual sensory deprivation.
                     Palinopsia is the persistence of an image after the stimulus has been removed. Polyopia is persistence of an image in space so that the same, single image is seen multiple times. Macropsia is the distortion of an image in space where it enlarges (“Alice in Wonderland” phenomenon). These phenomenon may be a result of migraines or epilepsy.<br>
                     Hypnagogic hallucinations are visual hallucinations that occur immediately before falling asleep or awakening (known as hypnopompic hallucinations). It is common in normal people and also in narcoleptics.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[   The first test performed was the Rinne test. Normally, one can hear the tuning fork approximately twice as long by air conduction as by bone conduction. Bone conduction greater than air conduction is suggestive of conductive hearing loss. Because the patient heard the sound twice as long with air conduction as he did with bone conduction, he does not have a conductive hearing loss. However, he did hear less sound on the left ear.<br>
                     The second test performed is the Weber test. Normally, the sound should be heard in the center of the head. In unilateral conductive loss, the sound is heard ipsilateral to the lesion, and in unilateral sensorineural loss the sound is heard contralateral to the lesion. Because the sound duration was less on the left ear on the Rinne test, and the sound was heard loudest in the right ear on the Weber test, the lesion is of sensorineural etiology on the left ear.    ]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[   Imbalance of labyrinth system is usually associated with vertigo, nystagmus, and ataxia. Semicircular canal damage is often characterized by vestibular nystagmus: low conjugate ipsilateral deviation of the eyes interrupted by fast corrective movements in the opposite direction. If the eyes try to fixate, it appears to move away from the side of the lesion. If the eyes are closed, then the surrounding seems to spin toward the side of the lesion. Bilateral symmetric vestibular dysfunction are often secondary to ototoxic drugs. Patients usually do not develop vertigo or nystagmus because their tonic vestibular activity remains balanced, but they complain of unsteadiness and vision distortion.    ]]></rationaletext>

                <text><![CDATA[A 50-year-old man has been complaining of hearing loss. Using a 512 Hz vibrating tuning fork, the sound was heard while held against the right mastoid process for about 10 seconds. Then when placed 1 inch from the right ear, the vibrating sound is heard for an extra 2 seconds before the sound faded completely. When the vibrating tuning fork was held against the left mastoid process, the sound was heard for 10 seconds. Then, when placed 1 inch from the left ear, the sound was heard for another 10 seconds. When the tuning fork was placed at the center of the forehead, the sound was heard loudest on the right side. Where is the lesion?]]></text>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[The first test, placing the vibrating tuning fork in the mastoid bone, then 1 inch from the ear is the Rinne test. Normally, one can hear the tuning fork by air conduction twice as long as bone conduction. Therefore, using the Rinne test, one can suspect a bone conduction hearing loss on the right ear, since air conduction only lasted 2 seconds longer in the right ear. This is confirmed using the Weber test by placing the vibrating tuning fork on the center of the forehead. In unilateral conductive loss, the sound is loudest ipsilateral to the lesion, whereas in unilateral sensorineural loss, the sound is heard loudest contralateral to the lesion. Since the sound was loudest on the right ear and the hearing loss is conductive and not sensorineural, the lesion is ipsilateral.]]></rationaletext>

DI can occur centrally as a result of decreased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) production or peripherally at the kidney as a result of decreased ADH responsiveness. These two types can be differentiated by the administration of ADH. If it is a central process, ADH will cause  an increase in urine osmolality. If nephrogenic, ADH will cause no change in urine osmolality.<br>

Headache is severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, and or temporal pain lasting 15 to 180 minutes untreated. Other characteristic features are ipsilateral autonomic activation (lacrimation, rhinorrhea, ptosis, eyelid edema, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and forehead/facial sweating), restlessness. It has a periodic pattern with consistent attack duration and attacks occurring at similar times in a day. Treatment for acute cluster headache includes sumatriptan (parenteral or intranasal) and oxygen. For long-term prophylaxis of a cluster headache lasting more than 2 weeks, calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, are preferred. A short course of steroids can be given for quicker headache relief while titrating up the calcium channel blocker.    ]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[   Short-lasting, unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) syndrome is a rare primary headache characterized by stabbing, burning, pricking, or electric shock-like sensation to an orbital or periorbital region unilaterally, extremely short duration, lasting seconds to less than 5 minutes, and mean frequency of more than 20 per day. This is associated with ipsilateral conjunctival injection and lacrimation. It may also be associated with ipsilateral rhinorrhea, eyelid edema, facial redness, and blepharospasm. Patients are headache free between attacks. The short duration of SUNCT make abortive treatment useless because by the time the patient takes the medication an attack would be over. Preventive treatment with a combination of carbamazepine and a short course of corticosteroids at onset may shorten duration of the syndrome. Age of onset is usually between 40 and 70 years.    ]]></rationaletext>

SSRIs, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), TCAs, BZDs, and MOAIs are effective treatments for panic disorder. In severely symptomatic patients, starting BZDs to treat acute anxiety while SSRI and TCA are taking effect, then followed by BZD taper, have been shown to be effective. SSRIs (fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and fluoxetine) are a first-line treatment. Jitteriness, restlessness, agitation, nausea and diarrhea, and insomnia are common side effects of starting with an SSRI, and necessitating starting at a low daily dose and gradually titrating up. TCAs are as effective as SSRI but are not considered first line due to the side effects. High potency BZDs (alprozalem, lorazepam, clonazepam) can be given to patients who cannot tolerate, or have received no benefit from, SSRIs and TCAs.<br>
                     Cognitive behavior therapy has been shown in randomized control studies to be effective in controlling maladaptive thoughts that cause patients to perceive normal bodily sensation as very frightening and uncontrollable.

Onset of withdrawal varies, depending on the half-life of the BZD that is chronically used. Treatment involves administering BZD with prolonged clinical effect, such as diazepam IV, and titrated to effect without causing excessive sedation or respiratory depression.    ]]></rationaletext>

They increase presynaptic release of catecholamines. Intoxication lasts typically for 48 hours. Behavioral symptoms include euphoria or affective blunting, hypervigilance, anxiety/tension/anger, poor judgment, and psychotic paranoia. It also causes autonomic arousal. Withdrawal causes depression, suicidality, tremulousness, lethargy, fatigue, nightmares, gastrointestinal cramping, and severe hunger. Substance-induced cerebral vasculitis also occurs in amphetamine users.    ]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[   The most likely substance responsible is cocaine, which acts by increasing the amount of NE, DA, and SE by blocking presynaptic reuptake receptor of these neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous system. Inhibition of presynaptic dopamine reuptake in mesolimbic dopaminergic system causes the psychosis associated with intoxication. Inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine in the adrenal gland causes postsynaptic medullary release of catecholamines (predominantly epinephrine) and systemic sympathetic effects. It is associated with hypertensive hemorrhages in young patients. The seizure could be due to the intracerebral hemorrhage or from the cocaine itself.<br>
                     Hallucinogens (mescaline and psilocybin) act as postsynaptic 5-HT receptor agonists. PCP acts as an antagonist at NMDA glutamate receptor and causes similar symptoms as cocaine, except for seizure.<br>
                     Anticholinergic poisoning from overactivation of the muscarinic ACh receptor leads to tachycardia, decreased bowel sounds, cutaneous vasodilatation (“red as a beet”), anhidrosis leading to hyperthermia (“dry as a bone and hot as a hare”), blurry vision from papillary dilation and inability to accommodate (“blind as a bat”), delirium and hallucination (“mad as a hatter”), reduced detrussor contraction and urethral sphincter relation (“full as a flask”).<br>
                     Activation of the opioid mu receptor causes analgesia, respiratory depression, and constipation.    ]]></rationaletext>

Patients have multiple motor tics and vocal tics. For the diagnosis, tics have to occur several times a day for at least 1 year, with no tic-free period of more than 3 months. It is a lifelong and chronic disorder with onset before 18 years of age, but often between 7 and 8 years. It has been thought to be due to dopamine hyperactivity. Stimulants and cocaine, which both increase synaptic dopamine, can worsen a tic. Treatment is with antipsychotics, and psychotherapy is not effective.

                     Depression is nearly two times higher in women than men, and women attempt suicide more frequently, but more men die of suicide than women. There is no monogenetic cause of depression, but having a first-degree relative with mood disorder increases the patient’s risk of a mood disorder. The consensus best treatment is a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, depending on patient preference.    ]]></rationaletext>

                     <i>DSM-IV</i> diagnosis of dementia is characterized by gradual and progressive decline in cognitive function with impairments in recent memory and one additional cognitive domain that is not due to other medical or psychiatric illness, and results in functional impairment socially or occupationally.
                        The NINCDS-ADRDA dementia criteria:<br>
                    • Probable AD is characterized by onset between 40 and 90 years, having the dementia syndrome established by clinical examination, confirmed with cognitive testing, and having deficits in two or more domains of cognition, progressive decline in memory and other cognitive functions, preserved consciousness, and absence of systemic or other brain disease that accounts for symptoms.<br>
                    • Possible AD includes having a dementia syndrome in the absence of other psychiatric or systemic disorders, but in the presence of a second systemic or brain disorder sufficient to produce a dementia but not considered as the primary cause after careful workup.<br>
                    • Definite AD occurs only when the clinical criteria for probable Alzheimer disease is met and tissue diagnosis by autopsy or biopsy.<br>
                     Rapidly progressive dementia is characterized by acute to subacute onset of dementia. Vascular dementia is characterized by stepwise worsening of cognitive abilities with associated history of cerebrovascular disease.    ]]></rationaletext>

There is an asymmetric atrophy of the left or right temporal lobe, more commonly beginning on the left. Patients have problems with word findings, initially with nouns more than verbs, but speech remains fluent. With progression, the patient begins to have problems not only naming but also recognizing words. They also develop compulsive interest in visually appealing objects. When the atrophy spreads to the right side, the patient begins to have problems recognizing emotions in others, then prosopagnosia, and multimodality agnosia for objects develop.<br>

A study has shown that smokers with insula damage from a stroke are more likely than smokers with brain damage not involving the insula to undergo a disruption of smoking addiction, characterized by the ability to quit smoking easily, immediately, without relapse, and without persistence of the urge to smoke. The insula is involved in homeostasis by regulating the sympathetic and parasympathetic system. Hypometabolism of the left anterior insular cortex has been associated with progressive expressive aphasia. Heschl’s gyrus is the primary auditory cortex, which is on the superior temporal gyrus. Wernicke’s area located in the supramarginal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere is involved in the comprehension of spoken and written language.    ]]></rationaletext>

About 30–35% of the patients may have borderline low vitamin B12 (150–200 pg/mL). Treatment is via 1 g intramuscular (IM) vitamin B12 daily for the first week, then 1 mg IM weekly for 12 doses, and then maintenance of 100 mg IM monthly or 1 mg every 3 weeks to prevent relapses.

Serial MRIs measuring hippocampal volume may be able to predict progression but not a single routine MRI. CSF beta-amyloid1–42 and mild-to-moderate elevation in CSF tau are biomarkers assisting diagnosis of AD.

Gamma-motor neurons innervate intrafusal fibers, which have small axons and control the level of tension on the muscle spindle to control overall muscle length and tone. Beta-motor neurons innervate both intrafusal and extrafusal muscle fibers. Renshaw cells are found in the ventral horn and send inhibitory signals to the alpha-motor neurons. Golgi tendon organs are located in muscle tendons and send inhibitory signals to alpha-motor neurons that have input to extrafusal muscle fibers, which mediate the inverse stretch reflex.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[ This is a classic descriptive finding in medial longitudinal fasciculus syndrome that carries nerve impulses from the abducens nucleus (that abducts the eye) to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus (which innervates the adducting eye contralateral to the prior eye mentioned). This results in dysfunctional adduction of the oculomotor-innervated eye. The eye innervated by the abducens nerve is able to abduct fully, but with nystagmus due to dysconjugate restriction of the contralateral adducting eye movement. Isolated abducens nerve palsy results in weakness of the abducting eye (not adducting eye as described in this vignette). Isolated oculomotor nerve palsy can leave the eye “down and out” because all muscles of eye movement, except lateral rectus and superior oblique, are innervated by the oculomotor nerve. The oculomotor nerve also carries sympathetic innervations, which in addition to the weakness of eye movement may cause a Horner’s syndrome of ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis. The sinus cavernous is composed of the abducens nerve near the internal carotid artery, and against the wall inside of the cavernous sinus are the oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve, maxillary nerve (V1 and V2 branches). Lesions of the cavernous sinus affect facial sensation of the upper and middle face (sparing the mandibular region sensation).]]></rationaletext>

This pathway, using the red nucleus as a starting point, travels down via the central tegmentum to the ipsilateral inferior olivary nucleus, which relays signal via the inferior cerebellar peduncle to the contralateral dentate nucleus of cerebellum, which then relays signal via the superior cerebellar peduncle back up to the red nucleus (contralateral to the dentate nucleus).]]></rationaletext>

The dorsal motor nucleus of vagus carries fibers to the nucleus ambiguous to supply special visceral efferent fibers that sends preganglionic parasympathetic vagal neurons that innervate the heart, lung, and gastrointestinal tract. The nucleus ambiguous supplies special visceral efferent motor fibers for swallowing and vocalization. The inferior salivatory nucleus projects special visceral efferent fibers to the otic ganglion (which then supplies the parotid gland).]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[ Horner syndrome results in ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis and results from dysfunction of the sympathetic system supplying the eye and face. Uncal herniation of the temporal lobe and posterior communicating artery aneurysm place pressure on the oculomotor nerve, which results initially in weakness of pupillary constricting fibers, which causes dilation of the pupil that may be nonreactive to light (“blown pupil”). With increasing pressure on the oculomotor nerve, paresis of eye movement develops and the eyes move to the “down and out” position due to sparing of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles, which are not innervated by the oculomotor nerve.<br>
                    Internuclear ophthalmoplegia refers to disruption of the medial longitudinal fasciculus that carries nerve impulses from the abducens nucleus (that abducts the eye) to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus (which innervates the adducting eye contralaterally to the prior eye mentioned). This results in weakness of adduction of the oculomotor-innervated eye. The eye innervated by the abducens nerve is able to abduct fully, but with nystagmus due to dysconjugate restriction of the contralateral adducting eye movement.<br>
                    One-and-a-half syndrome may result from a lesion in the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) and ipsilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus. The lesion of the PPRF results in weakness of ipsilateral gaze palsy (ipsilateral eye abduction and contralateral eye adduction) and the ipsilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (defined as having already crossed the midline on the same side as PPRF), resulting in weakness of adduction of the ipsilateral eye. The only muscle not affected in horizontal gaze is the contralateral lateral rectus and thus abduction is spared on that side. This results in paresis of all conjugate movements, except for abduction of the eye contralateral to the lesion.]]></rationaletext>

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[The boy in this scenario has a hypothalamic hamartoma. These lesions typically occur in infancy and childhood, producing a mass in the floor of the third ventricle. The pathology of these lesions show disorganized hypocellular collection of mature neurons and glia. Clinically patients will have peculiar laughing (aka gelastic seizures) and precocious puberty. These lesions may mimic pituitary adenomas with other clinical signs, such as acromegaly.<br>
                     The area postrema is a circumventricular organ located on the floor of the fourth ventricle and plays a key role in nausea. The mesial temporal lobe is a common location for epilepsy and is a target for epilepsy surgery. Lesions at the lateral medulla can cause a Wallenberg’s syndrome, with symptoms of swallowing difficulties, hoarseness, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, nystagmus, ipsilateral Horner’s syndrome, and ipsilateral ataxia. Additionally, there will be ipsilateral facial pain and temperature loss and contralateral body pain and temperature loss. The superior colliculus is involved in vertical gaze and lesions here can present with a Parinaud’s syndrome.

                <rationaletext><![CDATA[Anencephaly. Anencephaly is associated with failure of closure of the neural tube on the cephalic end, which results in absence of the major portion of the brain and skull and often leads to spontaneous abortion. Hydranencephaly results in the absence of cerebral hemispheres replaced by thin-walled membranous cysts that may have resulted from a hypoxic-ischemic insult. Holoprosencephaly results from failure of the cleavage of the prosencephalon that would later develop into two cerebral hemispheres with two lateral ventricles, which may be associated with severe facial defects such as cyclopia (one eye in the midline) and cleft palate. Periventricular leukomalacia are white matter lesions seen along the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles that may extend posteriorly along the ventricular walls from prior hypoxic-ischemic insults to the developing brain. Porencephaly is a cerebrospinal fluid-filled cavity lined by white matter that may result from prior destructive process as a stroke.]]></rationaletext>

Pick bodies are spherical, well-circumscribed neuronal inclusions that are slightly basophilic on staining found in cortical layers II and III, hippocampus, and amygdala. Lewy body is found in Lewy body dementia. It is a cytoplasmic inclusion found in the limbic region, substantia nigra, and neocortex. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are classically found in Alzheimer’s disease. Amyloid plaques are extracellular and stain for -amyloid. Neurofibrillary tangles are faintly basophilic and are composed of hyperphosphorlyated tau protein in paired helical filaments. Vascular dementia will have extensive microvascular hemorrhages and/or infarctions on neuro-imaging in the setting of progressive cognitive decline following a stroke.

Additionally, her ESR is elevated, but this may not always be the case. If clinical suspicion is high and ESR is normal, a temporal artery biopsy is necessary, which will show the multinucleated giant cells and necrotizing arteritis. The treatment is with corticosteroids. Temporal arteritis can be associated with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). This is a rheumatological condition that is classically described as stiffness or pain in the neck, shoulder, and hip girdle. It is typically worse in the morning. Other symptoms with PMR may include anorexia with weight loss and fatigue.]]></rationaletext>
